Amy Wilmington,1,"I am a native to the Chicagoland area currently living in Oak Park.   I received my masters in art therapy and believe in using art to communicate and connect with others. I chose to concentrate my paintings on animals because animals have personality and depth. How we see them defines who we are and what we want. Painting animals allows me to pay attention to the details and meanings of my world and the animals who inhabit it. For many of my animal paintings, I used a multilayered approach with watercolor, adding and removing layers. It’s through this process that I see the value and significance of the everyday.",Amy Wilmington Bun Bun.jpg,Amy Wilmington Cranes.jpg,Amy Wilmington Porcupine.jpg
Anna Hasseltine,2,"I am a Boston-born printmaker and recent BFA graduate from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. New to Chicago, I am currently working and creating fauna and flora prints in Pilsen. My most recent project is my Road Trip Series. It is a print portfolio comprised of twenty-one 9x12” portraits of different birds and flowers that I observed during a cross-country road trip this past fall. While I was on this trip, I would stop every so often and take note of the different animal and plant life I saw from state to state. When I got back to the studio, I created this series which I view as a field guide, a documentation, and a reflection of my road trip.

Most of my work is completed in the relief or silkscreen printmaking technique. My inspiration for my other work comes from the floral and animal species of William Shakespeare’s histories, comedies, and tragedies as well as the scientific documentation and illustrations of natural history. I am interested in Shakespeare’s metaphorical uses of the plants and animals in his stories, as they become symbolic representations of loss, greed, conquest, love and gluttony among other human emotions and traits. The second large component to my work is the research of actual behaviors and physical characteristics of the species I choose to depict by studying a variety of scientific illustrations. In my art practice, I create works that combine both natural science and Shakespearean stories.",Anna Hasseltine 1.jpg,Anna Hasseltine.jpg,
Bennett Art,2,"Amanda Bennett remembers painting with her grandmother as a child, who used a spatula as her primary tool. However, it wasn’t until years later, staring at the blank walls of her loft in Birmingham, Alabama, that she rediscovered her passion for the process of creation. Though it began as a practical answer to the abject poverty of life after college, this act of thrifty outfitting inspired her to cultivate her own unique style, a place where process demands as much attention as its end result.
As a Huntsville, Alabama native, Bennett moved to Nashville eight years ago where she finally got serious about her art. Her music inspired art gained local attention, as her signature guitars found their homes in local digs such as Fanny’s House of Music on the east side. When Bennett finally decided to release the paces of nine to five living, her art reflected her transformation. She moved through a transcendent few months of abstracts and then awakened one morning from a night of mixed media dreaming.
If you’re wondering where you’ll find Bennett lately, it’s snapping crazy cool shots of local characters and characters around Nashville and beyond, most recently capturing the soul and local flavor of the Mississippi Delta and New Orleans. Her latest series demonstrates her ever-evolving and rare perspective, a photographic journey of tales untold in the way Deep South. She has taken two things she loves, acrylic mediums and photography, and transformed them in to a funk style mash up on plywood for your viewing pleasure.
However, Bennett is never too far from her grandmother’s easel, creating art inspired by the technique and the soul of her teacher.

All pieces reflect my love for color, contrast, detail, and movement.

Dark Island City,2,Growing up I always had a fascination about houses/building and how they were constructed. In high school I took a vocation architecture/drafting class to learn how to draw and design houses. After high school I went to Suny Farmingdale on Long Island and majored in Architecture/Engineering Construction Management. I had worked in a architectural/drafting office from 2000-2010. While their I had worked my way up from organizing paperwork and drawing simple things like site plans and maps to working on proposed projects and different types of commercial properties. As the years went on the love for doing that type of work had slowly started to leave me and I was looking for a change in what I did. To this day I still love building and maps but now I just look at them in a different point of view.,,,

Its been four wonderful years since I’ve opened shop and every year has brought in opportunities for new ideas and new designs. Each order that comes through holds just as much excitement for me as my very first order.
Artists will often tell you to do what you love, work hard and it will not fail you. What I’ve learned in these last few years is that my personal success isn’t determined by the number of sales or praying for the chance to “quit my day job”; rather its in actually taking what I love, investing my time, creativity and imagination into it, and being rewarded with the gift that soon enough that magic will be heading off to brighten someone’s day.
That, my friends, is success for my soul and it plays a major role in the treasured happiness I have with my life.

Ink Bomb,3,"As a kid I was given a Moleskine as a present and was instantly in awe. I loved everything about this simple little book. The look, the feel, so empty, yet so full of potential. A blank beautiful canvas. It felt less like a journal, and more like an invitation, an invitation to create. I wasn’t sure if I would ever get another one, so for years I hesitated to use it. I eventually became brave enough to make the ﬁrst mark on that ‘clean slate’. The thoughts, ideas, poems, and drawings poured out of me like water from a broken main. Ever since I’ve not only enjoyed ﬁlling up my journals, but I also have had a burning curiosity as to what others do between the covers of their journals; what poetry is written, what doodles are drawn, portraits sketched, problems solved. As I carefully package the Moleskines to send to my customers, I wonder…what will ﬁll these pages?
To provide you with more background allow me to introduce myself; I’m Josh Mondie, entrepreneur, stagehand, investor and the creative soul behind Ink Bomb. As you might’ve guessed, the idea was sparked by a life long appreciation of art and creativity in its various and never-ending forms. I tend to express my creativity through graphic design and print-making, speciﬁcally screen prints on Moleskine journals. While I’m content working with the materials of the masters, ie., Van Gogh, Picasso, and Hemingway, in the future I intend to develop a more eco-friendly journal, using all recycled materials. My customers will tell you that my journals are special, they are shown the utmost care from the point of arrival in my hands, to arrival in theirs.  During the printing process, my 19th ﬂoor condo is transformed into a full ﬂedged art studio, each room utilized for either graphic design, burning screens, color mixing, printing, cleaning screens, packaging, etc. I do all of the work myself, from concept to delivery. Each print is unique, and individually printed by hand, which means no two journals will ever be the same. Buy confidently, know that you’re getting a truly one-of-a-kind piece, soon to be ﬁlled with your unique thoughts, drawings and solutions. I hope you enjoy your end of the process as much as I’ve enjoyed my end of it!",inkbomb.jpg,inkbomb2.jpg,inkbomb3.jpg

Jason Michael Bentley,1,"I am often moved to make an impression of what is beautiful and graceful. Even the simple aspects of applying a mark on paper or canvas can be a joy. And working with a suite of marks that eventually deliver form is a way of giving life all over again. I have not been an artist that desires to create something radical and leave a wake of mystification behind my every stroke. To me, for now, my drawings and paintings act as an outlet and reference to my studies and curiosities. They are embellished only by the way a unique individual can see the world as compared to another, honestly, and without agenda for something greater. I am not against exploration or fanciful ideas that help transcend one’s existence and understanding, rather, I simply enjoy growing into such a revelation by way of appreciating the smaller aspects of the application itself.",Jason Michael Bentley.jpg,,

Liz Tuckwell Paintings,1,"Liz Tuckwell is a painter currently living in Chicago, Illinois. Shortly after graduating with a BA in Spanish from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, she relocated to Amsterdam, The Netherlands where she dedicated herself to her artwork and her love of travel. After nearly ten years of creating art abroad, she returned to her hometown of Chicago in 2005. The main focus of her work is oil painting, which can most accurately be described as Abstract Expressionism.
She states, “ I truly began my painting career while living in Amsterdam with little more than cheap oil paints from a local Dutch market, a potato knife and paper.  Later, I discovered the use of brushes, I discovered the canvas and the story begins to write itself from there. My paintings are stories that burst forth from within me, often times telling me a story about myself. If we see art as an investigation into being, then my paintings are my investigation into my being; I paint what I feel, or rather what I am feeling comes through on each canvas.”

Madcanvases Chicago,2,"Mandy creates digital black and white photography collages which are sublimated onto canvas fabric.  She is a self-taught digital artist and uses her own photographic images as a base before manipulating them into an abstract, layered design.  Her pieces focus on the well-known landmarks of the city and the architectural aspects within.
The process of sublimation turns the inks from a liquid directly into a gas when they are heat pressed onto the canvas, where the ink essentially becomes a part of the fabric and allows the texture of the canvas to remain untouched.
Mandy has exhibited her work in art festivals, small galleries and coffee shops throughout Chicago and the suburbs and continues to look for new locations for her next piece.  She has expanded to landmarks across the Midwest and recently took trips to Boston, New York, Washington DC and Nashville to take photographs for future designs.  She also enjoys working with personal photos to create a one of a kind design that makes for an unforgettable gift.
Mandy graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Computer Engineering in 2003.  After moving to a new condo the West Loop in 2008, Mandy was faced with the task of decorating a large blank wall in her living room.  Her husband and she decided that they wanted artwork that represented Chicago and their new neighborhood but was not the standard, big box store version of the Chicago Theater sign.  Mandy ventured out to take pictures of landmarks around the West Loop and upon realizing that many of her photos weren’t the type to blow up for large format printing, she decided to try collaging four or five of the pictures together to digitally create one design and her style was born.

Shawn Stucky,2,"There are infinite ways to communicate ideas and emotions, and being a visual artist, I have found that I can relate to people through my work more deeply than other of mode of communication. It’s not an attribute that I necessarily sought to discover; rather, spontaneously feeling the urge to create, it seems that art sought me out and thus brought me into the world, becoming something I now uniquely share with many people.
Establishing a link to our unnamed feelings by mining my own various histories, I find that I can tune into a universal thread that connects me to my viewers using the process of destruction and reconstruction, all with the underlying goal of evoking feelings which people intentionally or unintentionally bury in the subconscious. When a successful connection is made – when the image most profoundly resonates with an individual – I find that these buried aspects of the self shake free and surface, iterating a more complete knowledge of ones own humanity. In the process, my own self-awareness has grown immeasurably.
Conversations, dreams, music and the unconscious mind are influences that have become foundational material for me. My endeavors start at a personal level, in a solitude I have come to appreciate as the home of my art, yet I have begun to expand into the community, working with other professional establishments and organizations, building upon ideas via collaboration which enrich the scope of my visual vocabulary and increase its accessibility. The way I envision a room or environment has now become a part of the endless effort to change and create an engaging atmosphere, both internally and externally.
I want to challenge myself to evoke the truths of human spirit while allowing others to transform and become emotionally absorbed within the beauty of unnamed feelings, perhaps eventually to be uncovered and named.

Steve Connell,2,"I love the way night transforms the urban environment. Instinctually we interpret our surroundings differently after dark. In this series of paintings I am trying to capture the unique mood and atmosphere created by night in the city of Chicago. I pick venues that attract this sensibility, some well known, others not. When I paint these images, I try to create a sense of stillness and urban isolation, as though the hour is late and the streets are devoid of people and traffic. The light reflections dance on the street and you can hear the echo on the sidewalk and the hum of the neon.

Chicago with its unique neighborhoods and rich history offers up a multitude of possible locations as subject matter for this series. I find myself like a moth being drawn to the light emanating from corner diners, bars, bakeries, theaters, etc. 

With a background in traditional painting, I have adopted new technology and create these paintings digitally on an iPad, using my finger as a brush. I start with my own sketch and build each image just like I would with canvas and paint, its just that now I can do this digitally. There is a satisfying immediacy to the medium. Painting on a backlit surface is like painting with light itself. A digital file allows me to create large canvas giclées, archival prints on paper as well as mounted prints on wood. 

Even before I lived here, Chicago was a city that seduced me. Through these paintings I am sharing my vision of this complicated, captivating city.

Each poster features an iconic image that represents the neighborhood’s uniqueness and history. The posters are screen printed on earth-friendly, recycled paper to give the prints a hand-crafted feel.
StudioChris and his wife are happy to live in Old Irving Park.

The Little Illustrator,2,"My name is Jen, and I am the illustrator and owner of The Little Illustrator. I have always had a love and passion for art, especially illustration and painting. I opened my shop back in 2008 with honestly not much direction or really any idea what I was doing. At that time, I was a hair stylist, and had a little girl to support, so I had pretty much put any ideas of having any kind of art career to the side.
Almost 6 years and four babies later, I’m now a mom to five children, four of which are four years old and younger! My little business is better than I could have ever dreamed it would be. It gives me a creative outlet that I had missed so desperately before, and it allows me to be home with my babies. It’s my dream job for sure!!
I LOVE that my art makes people smile and brightens their day. That alone is why I love what I do. Making the world a happier place one illustration and card at a time.

Thimble & Tag,5,"Hi! I’m Megan from Thimble & Tag — my handmade textiles company located in the heart of Chicago. I was introduced to sewing as a little kid but it wasn’t until recent years that I decided to pick it up and offer up my creations online and in local shops. I focus primarily on hand painted throw pillow covers, totes, wristlets, keychains, purses, clutches and zippered pouches. The inspiration for my pieces really come from me. I like to design products that are something I would want to carry. The fun for me comes with picking out all the colorful and happy fabrics and finding cute combinations that are one-of-a-kind. Painting my own look on some blank fabric has become a signature of my brand and I think really helps me offer truly standout pieces. ",Thimble and Tag.jpg,,
Tracey Capone Photography,2,"I am intrigued by the dance between shadows and light, the angles and lines they create and how everything works together to create dimension. Understanding these elements, and how unique vantage points tweak your perspective, has allowed me to photograph my subjects at uncommon angles which allow people to see things they wouldn’t normally notice.
Beyond my use of perspective, it is important to me to only photograph what I love, what intrigues me, not what I feel will be trendy or popular. Whether it’s Chicago, a sheep in Scotland, or a simple autumn leaf, being touched by the beauty of my subject makes me more invested in photographing it well. This lends itself towards a genuine emotion, both seen, and felt, in my work.
The craftsmanship of my work is just as important to me, and, ultimately, I create for the sake of craftsmanship, as a way to share my talent with others. I believe art is something that should be enjoyed by many, and not a select few, and, for this reason, I am always deeply touched seeing my work off to new homes. All of my work is hand mounted, by me, in my Chicago studio, on high grade, finished, birch panels using a process I have developed over the last several years.

True Partners in Craft,4,"Alexis Ellers under the name, True Partners In Craft acquires used bicycle inner tubes from friends and friendly bicycle shops across Chicago. She then cleans, cuts, hole punches, strings, twist and sews them into a variety of jewelry and accessories. Thanks to the many pot holes and broken glass strewn across Chicago bike lanes, True Partners In Craft is able to create beautiful recycled jewelry. Everything  is 100% vegan - so vegan that many of these tubes came from bicycles ridden by vegans.

Tuscany Creative,6,"My name is Katie and I am a former third grade teacher, now stay-at-home Mom of three. My kids are my inspiration for all the toys and gifts I design and make. All new creations have to be approved by my daughter Tuscany, who I named my shop after. Once I had my second child I decided to leave teaching so I could raise my daughter and son. With lots of creative energy to spare I started making fun and cute things for my six year old daughter Tuscany, my 2 year old son Agostino and my nieces in NYC. That’s when I knew I was really onto something special and decided to open my own store. Now I get to share all my creations with you! I have been in business for about 2 years and have sent my goodies to children in 40 states as well as 6 countries outside the Unites States. I also sell my creations in boutiques in New York & Chicago.",tuscany.jpg,tuscany2.jpg,tuscany3.jpg
